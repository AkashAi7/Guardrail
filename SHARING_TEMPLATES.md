I'm excited to share Code Guardrail - a VS Code extension that brings real-time security and compliance analysis to your development workflow.

🎯 Why I built this:
Security issues and compliance violations are expensive when caught late in the development cycle. Code Guardrail shifts that feedback left - catching issues while you code, not during PR review.

🔥 Key Features:
• Real-time detection of security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
• Compliance checking (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
• Best practice suggestions
• Powered by LLMs for semantic understanding
• Works with GitHub Copilot or your own API keys

⚡ Easy Setup:
One command, 2 minutes, you're done. No complex configuration.

🆓 Open Source & Free:
Check it out: https://github.com/AkashAi7/Guardrail

Perfect for:
✅ Development teams focused on security
✅ Projects with compliance requirements
✅ Anyone who wants to write better code

Would love your feedback!
